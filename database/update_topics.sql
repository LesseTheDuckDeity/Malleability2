<ul>
    <li>Describe the structure of DNA including base pairing rules</li>
    <li>Explain the process of DNA replication step by step</li>
    <li>Identify the key enzymes involved in replication</li>
    <li>Understand the significance of semi-conservative replication</li>
    <li>Analyze how DNA structure relates to its function</li>
</ul>

<h3>üî¨ Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Double Helix:</strong> Two complementary strands wound around each other</li>
    <li><strong>Base Pairing:</strong> A-T and G-C hydrogen bonding</li>
    <li><strong>DNA Helicase:</strong> Enzyme that unwinds the double helix</li>
