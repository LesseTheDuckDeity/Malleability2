                            <p>The concept of the atom has evolved dramatically over centuries, from ancient philosophical ideas to modern quantum mechanical models. The word "atom" comes from the Greek word "atomos," meaning indivisible, reflecting the ancient belief that atoms were the smallest possible units of matter that could not be further divided.</p>
                            
                            <p>John Dalton's atomic theory in the early 1800s provided the first scientific foundation for understanding atoms. He proposed that all matter consists of indivisible atoms, that atoms of the same element are identical, and that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms. While some of these ideas have been refined, Dalton's work established the conceptual framework for modern chemistry.</p>
                            
                            <p>The discovery of subatomic particles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure. J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment revealing the atomic nucleus, and Niels Bohr's planetary model each contributed crucial insights that shaped our current understanding of atomic structure.</p>

                        <h2>‚öõÔ∏è Dalton's Atomic Model</h2>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>John Dalton's atomic theory, proposed in 1808, consisted of several key postulates that provided the first scientific explanation for the behavior of matter in chemical reactions. His theory proposed that all matter is composed of indivisible atoms, that atoms of the same element are identical in mass and properties, and that atoms of different elements have different masses and properties.</p>
                            
                            <p>Dalton also proposed that atoms cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions, only rearranged. This concept became fundamental to understanding conservation of mass in chemical reactions. Additionally, he suggested that compounds are formed by the combination of atoms of different elements in simple whole number ratios.</p>
                            
                            <p>While Dalton's model successfully explained many chemical phenomena, including the law of conservation of mass and the law of definite proportions, it had limitations. The model depicted atoms as solid, indivisible spheres, which we now know is incorrect. However, Dalton's work provided the essential foundation for all subsequent atomic theories.</p>
                            
                            <p>The significance of Dalton's atomic theory extends beyond chemistry to physics and materials science. His ideas about atomic combinations laid the groundwork for understanding chemical stoichiometry and molecular composition. The theory also provided a rational explanation for why elements combine in specific proportions to form compounds.</p>

                        <h2>üî¨ Thomson's Plum Pudding Model</h2>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron in 1897 through his cathode ray tube experiments revolutionized atomic theory. Thomson demonstrated that atoms contained negatively charged particles, contradicting Dalton's idea of indivisible atoms. His measurements of the charge-to-mass ratio of electrons provided the first quantitative data about subatomic particles.</p>
                            
                            <p>Thomson proposed the "plum pudding" model of the atom in 1904, suggesting that atoms consisted of a uniform sphere of positive charge with electrons embedded throughout, like plums in a pudding. This model explained how atoms could be electrically neutral overall while containing charged particles.</p>
                            
                            <p>The plum pudding model successfully explained several phenomena, including the emission of electrons from heated metals and the behavior of atoms in electric fields. However, it failed to account for the results of later experiments, particularly Rutherford's gold foil experiment, which revealed that atomic mass and positive charge were concentrated in a tiny central nucleus.</p>
                            
                            <p>Despite its eventual replacement, Thomson's model represented a crucial step in understanding atomic structure. It established that atoms had internal structure and contained smaller particles, paving the way for our modern understanding of electrons, protons, and neutrons as fundamental building blocks of matter.</p>

                        <h2>üéØ Rutherford's Nuclear Model</h2>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment in 1909 dramatically changed our understanding of atomic structure. By firing alpha particles at a thin gold foil and observing their scattering patterns, Rutherford discovered that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by mostly empty space.</p>
                            
                            <p>The experiment revealed that while most alpha particles passed straight through the foil, a small fraction were deflected at large angles, and some even bounced back. This unexpected result led Rutherford to conclude that atomic mass and positive charge were concentrated in a tiny central region, which he called the nucleus.</p>
                            
                            <p>Rutherford's nuclear model proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus at relatively large distances, making atoms mostly empty space. This model explained the results of the gold foil experiment and provided the foundation for our modern understanding of atomic structure. However, it had a significant flaw: according to classical physics, orbiting electrons should continuously lose energy and spiral into the nucleus.</p>
                            
                            <p>Despite this limitation, Rutherford's model established the concept of the atomic nucleus and demonstrated the power of particle scattering experiments in probing atomic structure. His work directly led to the discovery of protons and, eventually, neutrons, completing our understanding of the basic components of atomic nuclei.</p>
